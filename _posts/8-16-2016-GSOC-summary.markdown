Woww, the summer has flown by fast and Google SoC with it! Here, with only one week to go before the final code submission, I wanted to take this moment to pause and look back on all of the work the was done and some of the work still left to do. So, without further ado, here is my GSoc in recap:

# Two New ODE Solvers, and one on the way...
## `ode4am`: a 
## `ode113`: a fully adaptive Adam Moulton solver
## `radau` : (WIP) an adaptive implicit Runge-Kutta

# Enhancements to IVP Benchmarking
## Getting the engines running again
## Experimenting with terminal mode
## More natural notebook mode

# JuliaCon
## My Talk
