  Hi there...
</div>
<p>  <div class="manual-content">
My name is Joseph Obiajulu and I am a rising Senior studying Math, Computer Science, and a little Physics at Princeton Unversity. This summer I'll be doing Google's Summer of Code, working with the Julia Language on their ODE package. I am being mentored by @mauro3 and @jiahao, and am looking forward to the summer spent coding!
